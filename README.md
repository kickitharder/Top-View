# Top-View

This is a simple webcam viewer for my observatory.  Here are it's features:

1)  The small window view stays on top of all other opened windows on the computer's screen so that the view can be constantly seen.
2)  Double clicking on the title bar will maximise the view to full screen (not always on top).
3)  Double clicking on the camera view allows the user to select a different camera source and resolution.
4)  The Top View window can be minimised and closed in the usual way.
